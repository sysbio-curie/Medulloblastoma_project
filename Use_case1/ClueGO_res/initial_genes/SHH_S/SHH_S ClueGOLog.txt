#Genes in GO_BiologicalProcess-EBI-UniProt-GOA-ACAP-ARAP_25.05.2022_00h00 : 10375

#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 10375 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: unique uploaded ids 22 -> corresponding genes 22, with 0 (0.0%) missing  -> All genes were recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 20 (90.91%) -> 2 (9.09%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to 7 representative Terms and Pathways (after applying general selection criteria): 8 (36.36%)
#Genes from all Clusters associated to 7 representative Terms and Pathways (after p-value significance selection criteria): 8 (36.36%)
