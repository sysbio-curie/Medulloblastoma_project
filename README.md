This folder contains supplementary materials for the NeKo project. The folder is organized as follows:

1) Use_case_1: This folder contains the supplementary materials used for the medulloblastoma analysis reported in the publication, including all the scripts, figures and data.


2) Use_case_2: This folder contains the supplementary materials for the second use case of the NeKo project, showcasing how NeKo can be used as input for the DrugLogics pipeline. The folder contains all the scripts and data used for generating the images reported in the original publication. Moreover, it also includes the synergy tutorial of the DrugLogics pipeline available at the following link: .https://github.com/druglogics/synergy-tutorial .


Each folder contains a separate README file with detailed information on the contents of the folder. The analysis for both use cases can be reproduced by installing neko using pip as described in the GitHub page (https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Neko).
